# Code of Conduct

(English primary version – a brief Chinese note may follow. 中文提示：本文件英文为主，若理解存在困难可联系维护者。)

This project adopts the principles of the Contributor Covenant v2.1 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) with project‑specific clarifications below. By participating you agree to uphold this Code.

## Our Pledge
We strive to provide a harassment‑free, inclusive, friendly, and productive environment for everyone, regardless of age, body, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion (or lack thereof), sexual identity or orientation, or technical choices.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Showing empathy and respect to all participants
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community
- Being honest about mistakes and seeking improvement
- Using welcoming and inclusive language

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments
- Trolling, insulting or antagonistic remarks, personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment or sustained disruption of activities
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances
- Any other conduct reasonably deemed inappropriate or unsafe

## Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces (repository code, issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki, CI logs) and in public spaces whenever an individual is representing the project or community.

## Responsibilities & Enforcement
Project maintainers ("maintainers") are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate, fair, and consistent corrective action.

Maintainers may remove or edit contributions that violate this Code (comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, discussions) and may temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for abusive, harassing, or otherwise harmful behavior.

## Reporting
Report violations privately via:
- Email: carm@carm.cc

Please include (if possible):
- Links, timestamps, or message IDs
- Description of what happened and why it is a concern
- Screenshots or logs (if relevant)
- Preferred or suggested resolution

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide an initial assessment within 7 days. All good‑faith reports will be treated confidentially and only shared with individuals who need the information to resolve the issue.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers will use these guidelines to determine the impact of an incident and consequences:

1. Correction
  - Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other unprofessional conduct.
  - Consequence: Private or public warning, request for change.
2. Warning
  - Impact: A single severe incident or repeated inappropriate behavior.
  - Consequence: Official warning; continued misconduct leads to escalation.
3. Temporary Suspension
  - Impact: Persistent violations despite previous warnings.
  - Consequence: Temporary participation suspension (issues/PRs/discussions). Conditions for reinstatement communicated.
4. Permanent Ban
  - Impact: Demonstrated pattern of harassment, hate, or threats; refusal to reform.
  - Consequence: Permanent removal from community spaces.

## Conflicts of Interest
Maintainers will recuse themselves from enforcement decisions where they have a personal conflict. A neutral maintainer or external trusted community member may be asked to assist when appropriate.

## Appeals
If you believe an enforcement action was made in error or was unfair, you may appeal by emailing the same reporting address within 14 days, providing context and justification.

## Attribution
Portions adapted from Contributor Covenant v2.1 and other open source community best practices.

## Changes & Versioning
Substantive changes to this Code will be announced in the repository (Release Notes / CHANGELOG / Discussions). Historical versions will remain accessible via Git history.

If unsure whether something is acceptable: choose respect, transparency, and ask a maintainer before acting.
